  <h1>WDD 330 Portfolio - Week 3</h1>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>Shorter syntax is usually preferred.</p>
  <p>The this keyword can make a function work for multiple objects as long as they all have the same property. ex
    this.name every object would need a name property.</p>
  <p>Objects are assigned by reference. You can point multiple variables at the reference but changing any of them
    changes all of them</p>
  <p>Namespace. Mutliple functions may have the same name in a large code which creates issues. If you put them in a
    object then the object name and method name will be unique and issues can be avoided.</p>
  <p>Computers count time from the Epoch which was the 1st of January 1970. It was picked for no specific reason. It
    counts in seconds since the Epoch.</p>


  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <p>What is a JavaScript symbol? Is it just an indication that it is special/unique or does it create an actual symbol?
  </p>
  <p>Does the dblclik event listener have a timer in which the clicks have to happen? It must because of the actions when I was playing with it. Can you change the length of the timer?</p>
<p>I feel like the quiz ninja project missed some steps in chapter 7. The picture of the example does not look like what it told us to do.</p>
