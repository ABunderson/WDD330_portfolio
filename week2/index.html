  <h1>WDD 330 Portfolio - Week 2</h1>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>JavaScript is backwards compatible which means that they cannot overwrite any old way of doing things and that they just add new ones that don't affect the old.</p>
  
  <p>I could not figure out code 3.2 without help. Not because it was beyond me, but because I could not understand their math logic.</p>
  

  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <p>Why does the book not say a method is no longer used until after they explain it and I've tried to memorize it?</p>

  <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
  <p>Callback = a function that is passed as an argument to another.</p>
  <p>const = a variable that cannot change. Default variable to use.</p>
  <p>let = a variable that will change.</p>
  

  <h2>Important JavaScript Information</h2>
  <p>Put all functions at the end of the code and the variables at the front.</p>
  <p>You don't have to define the type of variable.</p>
