  <h1>WDD 330 Portfolio - Week 1</h1>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>JavaScript is a high-level scripting language that is interpreted and compiled at run time. It is dynamic meaning it can change while running. It is constantly being improved to become faster.</p>
  <p>ECMA Script refers to a specification and JavaScript refers to the language</p>
  <p>Computers do not make good choices first. They go through all the choices until they find a good one. They are stupid but so fast they look smart.</p>
  <p>Design Process: Think, design, test, and then create</p>
  <p>Use comments to take notes while writing code.</p>
  <p>Design for the smallest screen first with a focus on content and functionality. Always give the consumer what they want quickly and easily because if they don't find it they will just leave.</p>
  <p>It is expensive to rework an entire website mobile first but worth it. More people use phones than computers to see sites.</p>
  <p>Put important things on the bottom of small screens where they are easy to reach with a thumb.</p>
  <p>Pop-up advertisements make people made. DO NOT USE THEM!</p>
  
  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <p>Is there a way to see a live preview while working on Visual Studios Code? I am using CodePen to see live previews but it doesn't always cross over well.</p>

  <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
  <p>SPA = single page applications</p>
  <p>PWA = progressive web applications. Like an app for a phone that doesn't need to be downloaded</p>
  <p>UX = User experience</p>
  <p>Responsive retrofitting = reworking a complete website to work for a phone.</p>

  <h2>Important JavaScript Information</h2>
  <p>In order to use getElementById with JavaScript you have to put the script src below the id you are linking it to. Make sure you are linking the folder at the right level. Use an opening and closing script tag no self closing tags.</p>
  <p>function theFunctionName(whatGoesIn)</p>
  <p>Use camelcase</p>
